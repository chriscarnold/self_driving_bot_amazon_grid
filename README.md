# self_driving_bot_amazon_grid
An application to find the shortest way for an autonomous vehicle to get from a Start point to a delivery pointon a 10x10 grid which represents a warehouse area.
The application will return a list of coordinates of all the waypoints it has traversed to get to the delivery point.
There will be randomly generated obstacles (20) and the vehicle will traverse around them. 
If the path to the delivery point is blocked, the application will identify the location of the obstacle that needs to be removed.
